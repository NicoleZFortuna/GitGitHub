# Tracking code with Git

## Creating a local repository
A git repository is a set of files associated with a particular project that are tracked together. To track a set of files, git needs to be initiated within the topmost level of a folder containing the work in question. Every file at and within the file hierarchy that git is initiated in will be tracked by git. If you are writing code in R, it is best to organise your code in an RStudio project, and then use RStudio to initiate your repository and track your progress.

An R package that is useful for automating a lot of the functions of git is `usethis`. This package is also useful if you ever want to write your own R package. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)
```

### Initiating a repository for existing code
If you have Git installed on your computer, you can turn an existing project into a git repository by executing the following line in the of your project:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
use_git()
```

The function will prompt you to make a first commit. Agree.

Alternatively, click **Tools** -> **Version Control** -> **Project Setup**, then click the dropdown box **Version control system** and select **Git**.

You should see a Git tab in the top right hand panel once Git is associated with a project. If you can't, select **View** -> **Show Git**. If it still does not appear, you may need to close and reopen RStudio.

### Initiating a new project with git 

In RStudio, click on **File** -> **New Project**, or the <img src="pics/ProjectButton.png" width="20"> button. A 'Create Project' window will pop up, and you should select **New Directory->New Project**. The following window will then open, allowing you to select a name for your package, as well as choose the directory in which the package will be stored. At this point, you can select if you would like to initiate this project with a Git repository. If you already have Git installed on your computer, I recommend that you check the **Create a git repository** box before you select **Create Project**.

A new RStudio window will open containing your new project. In your project window, you will see that a number of files have been automatically generated. These are your project file, and .gitignore file. We will talk about .gitigore later on. You should see these files listed in the Git tab in the top right hand panel. Now would be a good time to make your first commit. Go to the [**How to use git to track your package over time**](## how-to-use-git-to-track-your-package-over-time) section for instructions on how to do this.

## Hiding files from git
Within a project there are often a number of invisible files that are created automatically by the tools being used. For example, R will often generate a .Rhistory file that is of no benefit to you to track. In this case it is advisable to hide these files from git in order to prevent them from being unnecessarily tracked. Files are hidden from Git by placing them in a .gitignore file within the same directory that you initiated git.

For files/folders listed in .gitignore, the path directory of the files should be relative to the directory of the .gitignore file. You can edit the file by opening it in RStudio. Both methods for initiating a git repositories that were listed above should have automatically populated your .gitignore file with commonly hidden files.

If you have previously committed a file and want to stop tracking the file without deleting the file from your local working directory, in addition to listing the file in .gitignore, run the following line in either Terminal or Git Bash:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git rm --cached <.Rhistory>
```

If you want to hide but not delete a folder, you will need to include the argument `-r`:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git rm --cached -r <.Rproj.user/**>
```

In the above command `/**` indicates that you want to indicate every file contained within the .Rproj.user folder.

## Tracking project changes
Git keeps track of different versions of a project by taking 'snapshots' of the project at times specified by the user. Versions of a project should ideally be tracked (committed) at the completion of some new feature. Eg: once you have finished reformatting a file, have finished updating a function, or have completed an initial working version of some new function. This will prevent confusion if you ever need to revert to a previous version of a file.

A tracked file can exist in three stages according to Git. If a file matches the most recently committed version of the file in Git, it is considered Unmodified. If the file is edited in any way, it becomes Modified. When a Modified file is at an appropriate stage to be tracked by Git, it can be marked as a Staged file. Once a Staged file has been committed, this file returns to an Unmodified status.

Figure 2 demonstrates the different states that can exist within a git repository. The git 'database' contains a record of all the commits that have occurred up to date. The working directory is where you as a user do work. You can modify the files in the repository, and while git can recognise that the files in your directory may not match the most recent commit, git cannot add new changes unless you stage them first. By staging files that have been changed, you indicate which changes to be included in the new snapshot that will be added to the database. Figure 2 also indicates some example Terminal commands that can be used to transition between different states.

As stated previously, a Git repository can easily be initiated by running `use_git()`, including performing your first commit. You can also specify that you want to initiate your RStudio project with a Git repository. If you do it this way however, you will need to create your first commit yourself.

In the top right panel, you should see a **Git** tab, if you click on it you will be given a number of tools that will allow you to interact with Git. Along the top of this tab are a number of buttons that replace the most common Git terminal commands. This tab will also list any files that do not match the previous commit. This could be because the file was modified, or because the file has been created or deleted since the last commit. These types of files will appear as shown below. 

<center><img src="pics/GitTab1.jpg" width="400"></center>

Newly added files will have a yellow question mark under the Status column, while a modified file will have a blue M listed to the right hand side of the column. It can be seen that under the Staged column, neither of the boxes have been ticked off. This means that neither of these files have been staged to be committed. In order to stage files, the user simply needs to tick the boxes listed in the staged column. As shown below.

<center><img src="pics/GitTab2.jpg" width="400"></center>

Once these files have been staged, their status will change. New files will be indicated with a green A, while the blue M for modified files will now be listed to the left. To commit the selected files, select the **Commit** button. This will open up a window that will give the opportunity to provide a commit message. Provide a meaningful description of the changes that you have made, then select **Commit**.

If you would like to see the differences in the listed files when compared to the most recent commit, you can select the **Diff** button. This will open up the same window which will also allow the user to explore the differences for each affected file.

<center><img src="pics/Commit.png" width="500"></center>

## Recovering old versions of your repository
Git keeps a record of every committed version of a project. Each commit contains the version of each file at the time of the commit, the description of the committed version provided by the user at the time of the commit, as well as a unique ID number generated at the time of the commit. If the commit log is viewed, all previous commits made by users will be listed in reverse chronological order. To view this log of the previous commits, you can select the **History** button in the Git tab (looks like a clock).

There are many reasons as to why you may want to revert to a previous version of a file. It could be that the current solution that has been built is not viable, so you want to return to the time before your current fix in order to go in a different direction. It could also be that the current version of the project is broken in some way, and so you want to go back to a functioning version of the code. Regardless of the reason, this is a step that should be taken with caution, because once you have reverted to a previous version of the code, you will lose all the subsequent work that you have done. This risk can be mitigated through the use of branches, which we will discuss later.

If you want to revert to the most recent commit (and loose the most recent modifications that you have made), you can run:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git reset
```

If you would like to go further back in time in your project, you will need to refer to the exact snapshot that you want to return to. If you run `git log` in the terminal, you will find the ID of each snapshot you have taken. Use the description to find which version you want to revert to, and copy the first 10 (this is an approximate amount) or so symbols in the log ID. For example, the first few symbols of the version you want to revert to might be a6dsjd95y. In which case you would run:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git reset --hard <a6dsjd95y>
```

<b> NOTE: this is one of the few actions that cannot be reversed. If returning to a previous version, any more recent work will be permanently lost on that branch. TREAD CAREFULLY! </b>

## Creating and switching between branches
An amazing feature of git, is the ability to have multiple branches for a project. Different branches can be created if you need to debug a feature, create a new feature, etc. Once you are happy with your changes, branches can be merged back in to the master. The initial, automatic branch that is created when you initiate git, is called master. Any additional branches should be given a name that will indicate it's purpose. When you create a new branch, that new branch will have the entire history of the branch that you are currently working on. Therefore if you would like to revert to a previous version of a project, it is a good idea to first create another branch that will keep a record of your more recent commits as a backup. 

To create a new branch in order to develop a new feature:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git branch <NewFeature>
```

To list all the current branches:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git branch -a
```

To switch to a different branch (one of the branches that exist in your local repository):
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git checkout <NewFeature>
```

Once you are on your new branch, you can continue to modify your code as per usual, including creating new snapshots of the code. As you commit code on different branches, the log history of your branches will begin to diverge. Therefore it is important to make sure that you are doing work on the correct branch.

It is possible to push new branches to the remote repository so that other team members can look at the code before it is merged into the master branch.

To push an entire branch to the remote:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git push -u origin <NewFeature>
```

To return to the original master branch:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git checkout master
```

Before you switch to new branches, make sure that you have committed any changes that you have made.
 
## Merging branches
A consequence of having multiple branches with partially overlapping histories, is that if you want to merge two branches together, there may be conflicts in the code. The way that git merges files is by comparing the changes that have been made to the code in each of the two branches in comparison to the most recent shared commit history (the point in time when the new branch was created). If the changes in each branch have occurred in different files or lines in the code, then git will automatically incorporate those changes. If the same section of code has been modified on both branches, then git will require the user to manually merge the two files.

In the case that you are required to manually merge conflicts within a file, git will list the files that require merging. When you open said file, git will indicate all of the locations in the file that have been edited in both of the merged branches as shown in the example bellow:

``` {bash eval = FALSE }
merged code
<<<<<<<< HEAD 
version 1 of code
========= 
version 2 of code
>>>>>>>> a6dsjd95y 
merged code
```

At every point where you see the above, you will need to either choose which of the versions of code to keep, or find a way to incorporate aspects of both. In either case, you will need to manually change the file, including getting rid of the signposting generated by git. If you are using RStudio, you can directly open the file to edit it. You can also use the editor vim within terminal. Once you have made these changes, you will need to commit the new version of the file. The commit message should include which branches were merged and potentially how you resolved any conflicts.

## Suggested workflow for multiple

gitcreds_set()
The proposed work flow is recommended for multiple users to minimize the chance that work is lost. All commands are still run within the directory of the user's local repository. A graphical representation of this work flow can be seen in Figure 3.

On your local repository, build a new temporary branch that you will use to create a new feature:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git branch <feature>
```

Switch to that new branch:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git checkout <feature>
```

Once you have completed work on your new feature, commit the changes:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git add -A
git commit -m <"Built new feature.">
```

Switch back to the master branch and pull any changes that your collaborators may have made. This will allow you to merge any potential incompatibilities on your local machine.
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git pull origin master
git merge <feature>
```

If there are merge conflicts, resolve them and commit the resolution. Once conflicts are resolved, or if there were no conflicts, you can push your changes to the remote.
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git push origin master
```

Once you have pushed your changes, you can delete the temporary branch:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git branch -d <feature>
```

## Using git in RStudio

When developing a project in R, it is beneficial to organise any code or files associated with the project into an R project. This helps to keep your project organised, and also allows the user to take advantage of many of the features of RStudio. In relation to the usage of git, RStudio has it's own built in git user interface. In the top right hand corner of the RStudo IDE is the environment window. If git has been initiated for your project, you should see a git tab. This tab will allow you to perform almost all of the functions that you can perform through the terminal. In addition, in the Consol window, it is possible to open a Terminal tab that can allow you to interact with git as well. Depending on you comfort level and the complexity of what you want to achieve, you can use either of these methods to interact with git through your RStudio session. Personally, I prefer to use Terminal as the built in git features are slow to respond to switching between branches and registering file changes. Terminal instantaneously registers any change in the repository.

Git can be included when opening a new project, as you will be given an option to initiate git. If you have already established a project and want to add git version control, click on **Tools->Version Control->Project Setup...**. You will then be given the option to select the version control system that you want to use.

If you click on the Git tab within RStudio, you will be given a number of tools that will allow you to interact with git (Figure 4). Along the top panel of this tab are a number of buttons that can replace the most common git terminal commands. This tab will also list any files that do not match the previous commit. This could be because the file was modified, or because the file has been created since the last commit. These types of files will appear as listed in Figure 4. Newly added files will have a yellow question mark under the Status column, while a modified file will have a blue M listed on the right side of the column. It can be seen that under the Staged column, neither of the boxes have been ticked off. This means that neither of these files have been staged to be committed. If you would like to see the differenced in the listed files when compared to the most recent commit, you can select the Diff button. This will open up a window which will allow the user to explore the differences for each affected file. It is possible to stage files and commit them within this window. 

<center>
![Figure 4. An example of the git tab. Two example files have been listed that are not staged to be commited, including one modified file and one new file.](pics/GitTab1.jpg){width=50%}
</center>

<br>

In order to stage files, the user simply needs to tick the boxed listed in the staged column. As can be seen in Figure 5., once these files have been staged, their status will change. New files will be indicated with a green A, while the blue M for modified files will now be listed to the right. To commit the selected files the user needs to select the Commit button. This will open up a window that will allow the user the opportunity to provide a commit message.

In the top panel of the git tab, it is possible to pull from the remote repository (blue down button), and push to the remote repository (green up button). You can view the previous commit messages by clicking the clock. The blue gear button provides functionality to **Revert...** to previous commits, as well as to modify the **Ignore...** file. The button with purple shapes allows the user to create new branches, as well as add new remote repositories. Finally, you can see the name of the branch currently occupied. In the case of the provided example, this is the 'master' branch. If you click on the branch name, you will be able to switch between the branches that you have created.

### Open Terminal in RStudio

Terminal can be opened from within the RStudio IDE. It is opened next to the Console tab. If it is not already open you can open a new Terminal shell with the following keyboard short-cut: **Shift+Alt+T**. You can also open this window by clicking on **Tools->Terminal->New Terminal**. Once you have a Terminal shell open, you can use it as a regular Terminal window to initiate git and track changes in your project.
