# Git setup


## What is Git?
Git is a version control software which can track the development of your projects through time. Git will take a snapshot of your project at key stages (as indicated by you), which allows you to travel back to previous iterations of your project. In addition, git uses a feature called branching that allows the user to maintain multiple versions of their code at once. These versions can have different histories and incompatibilities, and can be used as a testing area when developing new features for your project. The functionality of git is best realised in multi-user projects as it keeps track of exactly who made what changes and when, and provides a mechanism to merge files that have been edited by multiple people. 

People who use git, will generally utilise both local and remote repositories for their projects. A local repository is one that is housed on your personal computer, and is where project development tends to occur. The remote repository can have several uses. The remote repository can be used as a backup of the work that you have done, so that you have an additional copy in case something goes wrong on your personal computer, or so that you can access your project from many different computers. It can also act as an intermediary for a project with multiple developers. If a project has multiple developers, each developer can work on their contributions on their local computer (as seen in Figure 1), and then add to the remote periodically (making sure to merge any conflicts between users along the way).

The most commonly used host for remote git repositories is [github](http://www.github.com), however there exists many alternatives like [bitbucket](htt://https://bitbucket.org/), and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/). Local repositories can be interacted with directly from the Terminal. However, many GUIs have been created over the years in order to make git more user friendly. If your project is being developed using RStudio, this IDE (Integrated Development Environment) already comes with inbuilt git functionality. Otherwise, a popular and easy to use GUI is [GitHub Desktop](http://https://desktop.github.com/). You will have seen a tutorial for how to use this particular GUI in the first week of [QBIO7006](https://shire.science.uq.edu.au/QBIOL/QBIO7006/docs/week1.html).

For the purposes of this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to interact with git directly through Terminal. When giving example commands, anything set between these symbols <> represents a variable input to be provided by the user. This tutorial gives a working knowledge of git which should be adequate for most git users. For additional help and further functionality, the book [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is recommended.

### Prerequisites
In order to interact with git directly from the command line, you will need to be familiar with navigating your computer through the terminal, as well as know how to edit files in the terminal by using vim. To brush up on these skills, refer to the UNIX and LINUX chapter of this document.

## Setup git on your computer
To download git, visit [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and select the correct OS for your computer. Depending on your OS; either git will begin to download automatically, or you will be provided with a variety of options for installation.

Once git has been successfully downloaded, you can initiate the global settings of git on your computer. While a variety of settings can be specified, the necessary ones include your user name and email, so that git can track when you make a change.

To set-up your user name, type the following command into Terminal:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git config --global user.name <"John Doe">
```

To provide your email:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git config --global user.email <johndoe@example.com>
```

To return your current user settings:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git config --list
```

To return a single user setting:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git config <user.name>
```

### Getting help with git
To get help directly from the terminal, the following commands are useful.

To get help with the most common git commands:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git help
```

For more commands:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git help -a
```

For help with a specific command:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
git help <config>
```
